    <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe</h1>
    <img src="cookies.jpg">
    <p>This chocolate chip cookie recipe makes dozens of cookies with crisp edges, chewy centers, and melty chocolate chips. It is truly the best!</p>

    <ul><em>What You Need</em> : 
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong>: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong>: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuts (optional)</strong>: Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul><em>Ingredients</em>: 
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons hot water</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><em>How to Make Coquito</em> :
        <li>Gather your ingredients, making sure your butter is softened, and your eggs are room temperature.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water; add to batter along with salt and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded spoonfuls of cookie dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container or serve immediately and enjoy!</li>

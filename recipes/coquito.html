    <h1>Coquito Recipe</h1>
    <img src="coquito.jpg">
    <p>Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico. In Spanish, coquito means "little coconut." The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum. Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."</p>
    <ul><em>What You Need</em> : 
        <li><strong>Evaporated Milk</strong>: This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: Two beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream of coconut</strong>: Canned cream of coconut lends richness and gives the coquito its signature coconut flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweetened condensed milk</strong>: Sweetened condensed milk makes everything more delicious, including this coquito recipe!</li>
        <li><strong>White rum</strong>: The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong>: Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong>: Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul><em>Ingredients</em>: 
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks, beaten</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can cream of coconut</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>½ cup white rum</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
    

    <ol><em>How to Make Coquito</em> :
